This is a game about trying to get lucky on a plane, but while that's happening, there are many things trying to prevent that from taking place and making you unlucky. An http://js13kgames.com contest entry.

## How to build project

This project originally created via Yeoman and the webapp generator. More info: [generator-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp)

        cd root-of-project
        npm install -g grunt-cli    # if you don't have grunt installed
        npm install                 # to get all dependencies
        grunt server                # for previewing app
        grunt                       # runs tests, creates a 'dist' folder with final minified files

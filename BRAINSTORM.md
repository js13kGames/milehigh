# "Mile High"

## Overview

Based on a true yet fictional story...

This is a game about trying to get lucky on a plane, but while that's happening, there are many things trying to prevent that from taking place and making you unlucky.

Originally I was thinking something about germs, plane filtration issues and hacking passengers (as I flew into Palm Springs) -- but this quickly became about having sex in the bathroom :-)

There was some team brainstorming during Nate's wedding and there are many options.

Puzzle-like version may be too complex, so Tower Defense might make more sense.

1. Tower Defense: One version is like Plants vs Zombies in that the lavatories are say on the left, and the unlucky things are coming at you from the right.  To power up: Was thinking maybe food carts serving oysters (analogous to the sunflowers and sunshine in PvZ) to gain points to create defenses -- or maybe you earn points by the length of time you're in the lavatory.

2. Puzzle-like: Or maybe you need to navigate around a cabin of a plane, sit next to a random person for a turn or two (to pick up someone to pair with), then have to get back to lavatory and hang out in the bathroom for enough time to do the deed. The puzzle is doing all this without being caught.

## Core Game Mechanic

The "simple yet fun" mechanic needs to be nailed down though...

## Some of the various things to defend against:

* Cabin staff knocking on the door

* the person before you blowing it up after chili making bathroom inhospitable

* TSA

* your partner being bored

* long line at the door

* your wife or husband :-)

## Defenses (or things that give you opportunities to succeed)

* When people are sleeping

* cabin staff not around

* distractions (baby crying, snoring, ...)

* turbulence (everyone needs to return to their seats)

* blocking the isle

* lavatory broken sign

## Levels

* Levels could be different plane layouts.

## Advanced challenges could be:

* picking up cabin staff

* trying to do the deed in the 1st class cabin lavatory
